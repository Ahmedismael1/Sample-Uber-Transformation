# Sample-Uber-Transformation

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to manipulate and prepare Uber data for further analysis.

## Features:

- Load and explore Uber data
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing steps
- Engineer new features based on existing data
- Encode categorical data
- Filter data based on specific criteria
- Group data and calculate descriptive statistics
- Generate reports and visualizations

## Sample Data:

#### This notebook assumes you have access to a sample Uber dataset with the following columns:
- VendorID: Unique identifier for each Vendor
- trip_distance_id: Unique identifier for each trip distance
- date_time: Timestamp of the ride
- pickup_longitude: Longitude of the pickup location
- pickup_latitude: Latitude of the pickup location
- dropoff_longitude: Longitude of the dropoff location
- dropoff_latitude: Latitude of the dropoff location
- passenger_count: Number of passengers in the ride
- rate_code_id: Unique identifier for the rate code used for the ride
- payment_type_dim: Payment type used for the ride (e.g., CRD, CASH)
- fare_amount: Fare amount paid for the ride
- extra: Additional surcharge amount applied to the fare
- tip_amount: Tip amount paid to the driver (currency required)
- tolls_amount: Tolls amount paid during the ride (currency required)
- improvement_surcharge: Improvement surcharge amount applied to the fare
- total_amount: Total amount paid for the ride (currency required)
- mta_tax: MTA tax amount applied to the fare
